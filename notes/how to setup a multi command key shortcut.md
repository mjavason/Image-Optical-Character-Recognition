Yes, you can combine the commit and sync actions into a single keyboard shortcut by creating a custom task or using an extension in Visual Studio Code. Here's how you can do it using the `Tasks` feature:

### Use an Extension

Alternatively, you can use an extension like **Multi Command** to combine actions.

1. **Install the Multi Command Extension:**
   - Open the Extensions view (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `X`) and search for "Multi Command". Install it.

2. **Configure the Multi Command:**
   - Open your `settings.json` file (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` and type `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`).

   - Add a configuration for the Multi Command:

   ```json
   "multiCommand.commands": [
     {
       "command": "multiCommand.commitAndSync",
       "sequence": [
         "git.commit",
         "git.sync"
       ]
     }
   ]
   ```

3. **Add a Keybinding:**

   - Open the `keybindings.json` file (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` and type `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)`).

   - Add a new keybinding for your multi-command:

   ```json
   {
     "key": "ctrl+alt+shift+c",
     "command": "extension.multiCommand.execute",
     "args": { "command": "multiCommand.commitAndSync" }
   }
   ```

This setup will allow you to press `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + C` to commit and sync your changes in one step. Adjust the key combination and settings to fit your workflow preferences.
